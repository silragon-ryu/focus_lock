## ‚ö†Ô∏è Notes & Troubleshooting

* **Windows-Only Features:**
  Taskbar hiding and full-screen PDF functionality work only on Windows.

* **SumatraPDF Path:**
  The app looks for SumatraPDF in standard install locations. If yours is custom, adjust the path in `get_sumatra_path()`.

* **Spotify Path:**
  Similar to above‚Äîcustom installs may require editing `get_spotify_path()` in the source code.

* **Bypass Protection:**
  While the lockdown is strict, advanced users may still bypass it depending on their system privileges.

* **Console Window:**
  On Windows, the console is hidden when the GUI starts for a seamless experience.
